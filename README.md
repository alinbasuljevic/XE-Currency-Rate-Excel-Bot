# XE-Currency-Rate-Excel-Bot
Interacts with XE API in order to parse and save individual or all conversion rates to an Excel sheet. Suggested as a project from a buddy.


Steps for setting up the bot:

1. Install all the requirements from the requirements.txt file. 
  a. Easiest way to do this is the following command in your computer's CMD.
    - pip install requirements.txt

*** If that doesn't work for you, individually install each module. ***
  
2. Run the main file and follow prompts.
